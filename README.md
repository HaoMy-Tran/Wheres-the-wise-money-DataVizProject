I caught a article a on the Internet of a Vietnamese national journal. this is about stock news. it's title is kind of like " Where does the "wise money" go?"
this was written in Vietnamese so I translated to English but only the main ideas. Find the original [here](https://laodong.vn/tien-te-dau-tu/chung-khoan-tien-khon-dang-chay-vao-co-phieu-nao-1041204.ldo), and the transcipt here. The article is bad and it just needs to be improved. So I decided to give it a better visualization so the information would be conveyed more effective.  

in this article, I like the way they used the graph to tranmit the story instead of throwing a buch of information with hypnotizing numbers. However, as you take more time to read this news, it happens that the viz is so weak and it literally didn't help the article at all. 
- Bar chart is the good choice, the industries's name are listed in a logical order so the audience are easier to read the chart.
After inspect the chart carefully, I listed down the weaknesses of this viz, which are:
- it gets me confused, or even misled, about exactly what it is trying to tell. this can be caused by the lack of a clear title/subtitle, lack of the scale for the x and y axises.
- I also do not know why they highlight the VN-Index item over the other ones while they did not mention any further information in the article.
- The viz gives 

Pros:
- I like the idea of using visualization to summarize the information
In this article, they use bar chart to show the information instead of throwing out a buch of hynotizing numbers. 
- The good use of chart
Bar chart is such a good idea to visualize because it is simple and intuitive especially when comparing among several items.
Cons:
+ The article does not leverage the advantage of data visualization
The article does not use bar chart to reflect crucial problem, or in other words, the chart does not help answer the topic question which is “Where is the money flowing into?”
+ The problem with the bar chart make it hard to support the the article in an effective way. 
In the article, the bar chart summarize the information of a paragraph. However, the audience would find difficult to identify this paragraph. The chart gets the audience confused, or even misled
Let’s inspect the problems with this data visualization and try to improve it.
+ the lack of title/subtitle gives the audience an ambiguous idea about what the chart is telling. 
+ the following pararaph actually explains for the other story.  
+ Add redundan information 
VN-INDEX, HNX, UPCOM are the items that difference from the else ones. However, throughout the article, these index, or its relationship with other items, are not mentioned at all. There are no explanation for why they are in the chart and how they interact with the other ones.
+ weak use of highlight effects
It is easy to spot the red rectangular  is added to attract the audience’s attention to the VN-INDEX item. However, this is such a lazy type of highlight and does not give an aesthetic pleasing.

In this project, my effort will narrow down to the second part of the article which start with the question “Where is the money flowing into?”. I will try to meet two goals:
- Answer the topic question “Where is the money flowing into?”
- Improve the chart in the article. 
This is how I do:
- The first chart, please find the attached files to have the pdf file version
-pic-
- I collected the raw data from the article. If you read the article, the data measures the same type of information but in different time reference. To answer the question, my first chart uses the data which shows the cash flowing into a certain industries. This data compares between April and March. 
- The first idea was to create two contrast sections which indicated the in and out of cashflow. 
- I choosed column chart because it is simple and intuitive. I choosed Excel to visualize because with the usual types of chart, Excel will be the best tool. Also, I did not have to import the dataset.
- I creates the columns chart with the their labels that I thought necessary and push all of them to the background by making them grey. This is the way I do a chart. I put every think in background and only fill color to the objects that contain crucial information. 
- Then, I filled the positive percentage with green because I want them to be associated with the green on the stock tickers. In the stock tickers, the green means the rise of stock prices and the red means the decline. However, I did not choose the red for the decreasing percentages because I do not want the audience attention on this part. So I push the cash flowing out in grey. 
- I added the dollar sign to indicate the flowing direstion of money. 
- Finally, I add data labels for all the columns. I also delete y-axis because it is now redundant.
The second chart (fixing the old one)
-  Simlilar to the first chart, after having all the data from the bar chart, I used Excel to create a column chart because I thought it would be better reflection of decreasing numbers. In the picture below, a VN-Index line is added as a better way of highlightign a item.  However, this can be omitted because it is not relevant to the article’s content. 
- Start with an all-grey chart,  I choosed red for the columns to let audience associate with the decreasing prices on the stock tickers.
- Then, I add data labels for the add-in information in the article taking about some of the data points. I kept the y-axis because there were too many columns for each comlumn data labels. 
- Finally, title and subtitle were added and now we have the present column chart.

# Introduction
I love data visualization, I love charts and graphic products. So my eyes are really sensitive with charts, shapes and colors. I believe that there will always a way to facititate the information digestion process for the audience by using data visualization.
So there was a time when I was reading news on the Internet, I saw [this article](https://laodong.vn/tien-te-dau-tu/chung-khoan-tien-khon-dang-chay-vao-co-phieu-nao-1041204.ldo). This is an Vietnamese national journal about stock news. It's title is kind of like " Where does the "wise money" go?". And as you can guess, the chart immediately reached my eyes and got my attention. 
I mean, it is such a wonderfull idea to add a viz to a type of article that is supposed to be full of numbers. But the thing is, this chart failed to aid the readers to digest the article. And turns out, it does not help at all.
I think data visualization is not so popular in this kind of article in Vietnam. People may add it like adding eye's candy for the dull news pages. Anyway, I believe it's worth me a try to give it a better visualization so the information would be conveyed more effective, because at the end of the day, I think, the audience deserve to have an easier way to digest information. 
 
Let's consider this viz and see how much we can help this viz communicate more effectively 

# Inspection
These followings are the pros and cons of the data viz 
## Pros
* Using a cooler way to tell the story
In this article, they use a chart to show the information instead of throwing out a buch of hynotizing numbers. Obviously, information in graphic form will be much easier to absorb.
* The good use of chart
Bar charts is such a good choice in this article to visualize because they are simple and intuitive especially when comparing among several items. Additionally, the industries'name are listed in a logical order so the audience are easier to read the chart. The highlight also is added to grasp the attention.
## Cons
* The article does not leverage the advantage of data visualization
The article does not use bar chart to reflect the crucial problem, or in other words, the chart does not help answer the topic question which is “Where is the money flowing into?”
* The problems with the bar chart make it hard to support the the article in an effective way. 
In the article, the bar chart summarize the information of a paragraph. However, the audience would find difficult to identify this paragraph. The chart gets the audience confused, or even misled
After studying the chart, I think there are some problems that need to be considered
  * The lack of title/subtitle gives the audience an ambiguous idea about what the chart is telling.  
  * Adding redundant information 
VN-INDEX, HNX, UPCOM are the items that difference from the else ones. However, throughout the article, these index, or its relationship with other items, are not mentioned at all. There are no explanation for why they are in the chart and how they interact with the other ones.
  * Weak use of highlight effects
It is easy to notice the red rectangular is added to attract the audience’s attention to the VN-INDEX item. However, this is such a lazy type of highlight and does not give an aesthetic pleasing.  

# Complement  
In this project, my work will narrow down the scope to the second part of the article which start with the question “Where is the money flowing into?”. Accordingly, I will try to archieve two goals, answering the topic question “Where is the money flowing into?” and improving the chart in the article. 
## Answering the topic question “Where is the money flowing into?”
The first chart, please find the attached files for the pdf file version
-pic-
- I collected the raw data from the article. If you read the article, the data measures the same type of information but in different time reference. To answer the question, my first chart uses the data which shows the cash flowing into a certain industries. This data compares between April and March. 
- The first idea was to create two contrast sections which indicated the in and out of cashflow. 
- I choosed column chart because it is simple and intuitive. I choosed Excel to visualize because with the usual types of chart, Excel will be the best tool. Also, I did not have to import the dataset.
- I creates the columns chart with the their labels that I thought necessary and push all of them to the background by making them grey. This is the way I do a chart. I put every think in background and only fill color to the objects that contain crucial information. 
- Then, I filled the positive percentage with green because I want them to be associated with the green on the stock tickers. In the stock tickers, the green means the rise of stock prices and the red means the decline. However, I did not choose the red for the decreasing percentages because I do not want the audience attention on this part. So I push the cash flowing out in grey. 
- I added the dollar sign to indicate the flowing direstion of money. 
- Finally, I add data labels for all the columns. I also delete y-axis because it is now redundant.
The second chart (fixing the old one)
-  Simlilar to the first chart, after having all the data from the bar chart, I used Excel to create a column chart because I thought it would be better reflection of decreasing numbers. In the picture below, a VN-Index line is added as a better way of highlightign a item.  However, this can be omitted because it is not relevant to the article’s content. 
- Start with an all-grey chart,  I choosed red for the columns to let audience associate with the decreasing prices on the stock tickers.
- Then, I add data labels for the add-in information in the article taking about some of the data points. I kept the y-axis because there were too many columns for each comlumn data labels. 
- Finally, title and subtitle were added and now we have the present column chart.

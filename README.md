I caught a article a on the Internet of a Vietnamese national journal. this is about stock news. it's title is kind of like " Where does the "wise money" go?"
this was written in Vietnamese so I translated to English but only the main ideas. Find the original [here](https://laodong.vn/tien-te-dau-tu/chung-khoan-tien-khon-dang-chay-vao-co-phieu-nao-1041204.ldo), and the transcipt here. The article is bad and it just needs to be improved. So I decided to give it a better visualization so the information would be conveyed more effective.  

in this article, I like the way they used the graph to tranmit the story instead of throwing a buch of information with hypnotizing numbers. However, as you take more time to read this news, it happens that the viz is so weak and it literally didn't help the article at all. 
- Bar chart is the good choice, the industries's name are listed in a logical order so the audience are easier to read the chart.
After inspect the chart carefully, I listed down the weaknesses of this viz, which are:
- it gets me confused, or even misled, about exactly what it is trying to tell. this can be caused by the lack of a clear title/subtitle, lack of the scale for the x and y axises.
- I also do not know why they highlight the VN-Index item over the other ones while they did not mention any further information in the article.
- The viz gives
